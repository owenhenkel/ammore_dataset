AMMORE contains 53,298 student answers to open response practice questions, assembled from a subset math practice sessions on Rori of 2,508 at-home users that took place between January 1st and April 30th, 2024. Each response in our dataset was scored by a pre-existing, rules-based classification model, native to Rori, which classifies answer attempts as “correct”, “wrong” or “other”. The latter was typically returned when a student entered something besides an answer attempt, such as a voice note or a sticker. These classifications were then manually reviewed by humans, and changed where necessary, meaning the dataset also has a ground truth score for each student answer. The dataset is comprised of students’ answers to math questions from Rori lessons from grade levels 6 to 9 in the domains “Algebra” and “Number and operations”. Each student answer is paired with the corresponding question, the expected response, a ground-truth correct/incorrect score, the specific learning standard evaluated by the question, the time the student answered, and a UID number that can be used to link student responses across the dataset.
